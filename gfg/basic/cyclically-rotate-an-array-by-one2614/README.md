# Rotate Array by One

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    void rotate(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        
        if (arr.empty())
        return; 
        
        int n=arr.size();
        int temp=arr[n-1];
        
        for(int i=n-1; i>0; i--){
            arr[i]=arr[i-1];
        }
        arr[0]=temp;
       
    }
    
    
};
```
