# Array Leaders

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array  **`arr`**  of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

**Examples:
**

```
Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.

```

```
Input: arr = [10, 4, 2, 4, 1]
Output: [10, 4, 4, 1]
Explanation: Note that both of the 4s are in output, as to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right. side
```

```
Input: arr = [5, 10, 20, 40]
Output: [40]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in increasing order, only the rightmost element is leader.
```

```
Input: arr = [30, 10, 10, 5]
Output: [30, 10, 10, 5]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in non-increasing order, all elements are leaders.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> leaders(vector<int>& arr) {
        
        vector<int>ans;
        // code here
        int n=arr.size();
        int lead=arr[n-1];
        
        ans.push_back(lead);
        
        for(int i=n-2; i>=0; i--){
            if(arr[i]>=lead){
                ans.push_back(arr[i]);
                lead=arr[i];
            }
            else{
                continue;
            }
        }
         reverse(ans.begin(),ans.end());
         
         return ans;
        
    }
};
```
