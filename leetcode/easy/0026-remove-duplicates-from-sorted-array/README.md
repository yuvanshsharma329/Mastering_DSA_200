# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in  **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates  **in-place**  such that each unique element appears only  **once**. The  **relative order**  of the elements should be kept the  **same**.

Consider the number of  *unique elements*  in `nums` to be `k​​​​​​​`​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements `k`.

The first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the unique numbers in  **sorted order**. The remaining elements beyond index `k - 1` can be ignored.

 **Custom Judge:** 

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be  **accepted**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

                nums[i]=nums[j];
            }
